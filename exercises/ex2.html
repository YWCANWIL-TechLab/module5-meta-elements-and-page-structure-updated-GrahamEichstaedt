            <h1>Exercise 2: </h1>
            <p>
                This module introduced the concept of <i>semantic elements</i>, which are used to provide information for browsers, search
                engines, and screen readers. We can use these to provide extra structure to our website.
            </p>
            <a href="../index.html" class="link">Home</a>
        </header>
        <section id="questions" class="container">
            <p id="q1">
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a new section. Inside of the new section, create a paragraph element
                with text that says "I made a section element!".
            </p>
            <p id="q2">
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a new header. The header should have a heading and a paragraph element,
                but either element can have any text you would like.
            </p>
            <p id="q3">
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a new article. The article should have a heading (h1 has already been
                used) that says: "Music streaming royalties to be discussed by government". It should also have a paragraph element
                that says: "The music industry has committed to improving metadata for tracking songs on music streaming platforms, 
                following widespread criticism from artists. "
            </p>
            <p id="q4">
                Inside the section with an id of answers, create a new footer element. The element should have some generic contact info.
                I would not recommend using your actual contact info, since this will be available online and you probably don't want
                random people contacting you should they find it.
            </p>
            <p id="q5">
                Aside elements are usually used for content that is not directly related to a page. It is also a common place for 
                advertisements. Inside of the element with an id of answers, create a new aside element. The element should be a paragraph
                asking the user to buy something to serve as our ad. 
            </p>
            <p id="q6">
                A figure element works like a figure in a textbook. They generally are an image with some kind of caption. Please create
                a figure element with a figcaption element. The image used should be yosemite-valley.jpg. Be sure to give the image some
                kind of description.
            </p>
