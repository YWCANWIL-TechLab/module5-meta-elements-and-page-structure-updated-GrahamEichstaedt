            <h1>Exercise 4: Responsive Design</h1>
            <p>Responsive design is the practice of making sure a website will look good no matter what size screen is viewing it. This 
                is one of the pillars of modern web design.
            </p>
            <a href="../index.html" class="link">Home</a>
        </header>
        <section class="container">
            <p id="q1">
                The first step to creating a responsive webpage is always to set the viewport. Please set the viewport.
            </p>
            <p id="q2">
                Inside of the section with an id of "answers", please create an image element using arches-np.jpg.
            </p>
            <p id="q3">
                If you check the image you just created in your browser window, it won't fit the screen right and is kind of obnoxious to 
                look at. Change this by setting its width to 100%.
            </p>
            <p id="q4">
                Create another image element using great-sand-dunes.jpg and set its width to 100%. This image has a much smaller resolution,
                so you should max sure to set its max width to the appropriate width. This will stop the image from stretching.
                You can find the appropriate width by opening the image and clicking the "file info" button.
            </p>
            <p id="q5">
                Different screen sizes work best with different image sizes. You can have dynamic images / dynamic image sizing by using
                picture elements. You should use arches-np with a max-width of 1500px, angels-landing for a max-width of 1200px, and 
                grand-teton with a max-width of 500. Be sure to resize the screen to see the images change.
            </p>
            <p id="q6">
                Static units can be inconvenient since we do not create websites for a single size of screen. We can use <i>viewport</i>
                units to make sure that our text will scale with our viewport's size. You can change the font-size of any element using
                the style attribute. Change paragraph's font-size to 5vw. Then resize the page and watch what happens to the text.
