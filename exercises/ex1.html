            <h1>Exercise 1: Meta Elements</h1>
            <p>
                This unit covers our different meta elements and the structure of our HTML pages. We are able to use these new meta elements
                to replace some of the elements we have been using. Meta elements add value to our website by passing extra info to our 
                browser, which is valuable for Search Engines.
            </p>

                There are several problems with this HTML page. To begin fixing it, please create an appropriate and descriptive
                title element.
            </p>
            <p id="q2">
                When you set a title it will only display on the browser tab, but it looks a little strange without an icon. There is an
                icon for you to use inside of the images folder. Create a link element with the rel set to "icon". Use this link element
                to add that image.
            </p>
            <p id="q3">
                A chacter set is the collection of characters you use to represent text on a computer. There have been many different 
                character sets over the years, like ASCII, but the one we use almost universally know is UTF-8, which includes every 
                character of all <i>known</i> written languages. Please create a new meta element to specify the character set.
            </p>
            <p id="q4">
                Keywords help search engines find out website. Create a new element with some keywords that describe this webpage. you
                may choose which keywords to use.
            </p>
            <p id="q5">
                Descriptions help search engines direct traffic to our sites as well. Please create a meta element with a description of 
                what this webpage is.
            </p>
            <p id="q6">
                Don't forget to sign your name on your work! Create a meta element specifying who the author is.
            </p>
            <p id="q7">
                Let's make sure our information is up to date. Create a meta element that will refresh the page every minute.
            </p>
            <p id="q8">
                Nearly 60% of all web traffic comes from mobile devices rather than computers. Mobile devices have small screens, so if 
                we do not alter our User Experience Design, they will not enjoy coming to our web site. We can handle this by setting a 
                viewport size. Please set this page's viewport.
