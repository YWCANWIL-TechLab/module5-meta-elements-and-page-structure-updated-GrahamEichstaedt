# Module5-Meta-Elements-and-Page-Structure

In this module we'll be covering the concept of Meta Elements and Semantic HTML, both of which give valuable information to web browsers,
search engines, and screen readers. We can use these different elements to help get more traffic for our websites. Additionally, we'll
get a taste of some important CSS layouts and how to make them. These features will be a core component of responsive web design, which 
is a very important for delivering a great User Experience. However, we will not be practicing with Flexbox or Grid until the CSS Unit.
